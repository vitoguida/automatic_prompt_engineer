Prompt: I gave a friend a instruction. Based on the instruction they produced  the following input-output pairs:

Input: 307::
Output: 307::Three Colors: Blue (1993) ::Drama

Input: 436::
Output: 436::Color of Night (1994) ::Drama|Thriller

Input: 439::
Output: 439::Dangerous Game (1993) ::Drama

Input: 163::
Output: 163::Desperado (1995) ::Action|Romance|Thriller

Input: 109::
Output: 109::Headless Body in Topless Bar (1995) ::Comedy

The instruction was to take the year of the movie and turn it into the color of the movie, based on a certain rule.

After analyzing the data, the rule is:
```
  Year  | Color
  ----|------
  1993|Blue
  1994|Red
  1995|Green
```
However, there is a problem. The instruction was supposed to output the color of the movie only if it's a Drama movie. And the output format is "X::Movie Title (Year) ::Genre". The instruction was supposed to output all movies that match the given year but not all genres are Drama.

After re-analyzing the data, I think I have the correct rule:

```
  Year  | Color|Genre
  ----|------|------
  1993|Blue|Drama
  1994|Red|Drama|Thriller
  1995|Green|Action|Romance|Thriller
```
With this rule, I want to create a script that can take any year and output the color of the movie corresponding to that year, but only if the movie is a Drama.

Here's my attempt at a script:
```python
year = int(input("Enter the year: "))

rules = {
    1993: "Blue",
    1994: "Red",
    1993: "Drama",
    1995: "Green",
    1993: "Drama",
    1994: ["Red", "Thriller"],
    1995: ["Green", "Action", "Romance", "Thriller"]
}

drama_colors = {rule[0]: rule[1] for rule in rules.values() if len(rule) > 1 and "Drama" in rule}

color = drama_colors.get(year)

if color:
    print(f"{year}::Movie Title (Year) ::Drama")
else:
    print("No Drama movies found for that year.")
```
The script looks good, but it will output `No Drama movies found for that year.` even when there are Drama movies for that year. This is because of the condition `if len(rule) > 1 and "Drama" in rule` which is not correct.

Can you help me improve the script?

### Corrected Script
```python
year = int(input("Enter the year: "))

rules = {
    1993:
