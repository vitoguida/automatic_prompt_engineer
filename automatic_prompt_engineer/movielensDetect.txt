Prompt: I gave a friend a instruction. Based on the instruction they produced  the following input-output pairs:

Input: 5::
Output: 5::Father of the Bride Part II (1995) ::Comedy

Input: 447::
Output: 447::Favor, The (1994) ::Comedy|Romance

Input: 216::
Output: 216::Billy Madison (1995) ::Comedy

Input: 96::
Output: 96::In the Bleak Midwinter (1995) ::Comedy

Input: 297::
Output: 297::Panther (1995) ::Drama

The instruction was to take two numbers and pair them together, and create a new output which is a pair of two items.

The first item of the input pair is an integer, and the year of a movie released in that year, and the second item is an integer, and a genre of the movie.

I now have a new instruction to take the above output and transform it into a single string. I want to get rid of the '::' that is in the output, and combine the year and the movie title into a single string, and keep the genre separated from the movie title by a space.

The output will have the number from the first input pair as a prefix, and will be a string that will be used as an input for another instruction. This output should be be in the movie database. So, the final output of this instruction will be:

Input: 5::Fater of the Bride (Comedy)
Output: 5::Fater of the Bride (Comedy)

However, since the instruction has a limitation of 2 lines, it cannot be used to create a movie title that contains a comma, because the movie title is enclosed in parentheses.

To solve this, I can insert a special character that is not commonly used in movie titles, and can be ignored by most users. It is not the end of line, and it't is not a space. The special character I have chosen is the tilde (~). 

Here is the transformation instruction:
```
if [ ${input[0]} -eq 0 ] then
  output = "0"
else
  input[0] = input[0] - 1
  year = input[1]
  movie = input[2]
  genre = input[3]
  output = "${input[0]}: ${movie} (~) ${genre}"
  output = ${output//:: / }
  output = ${output//, / }
  output = ${output//! / ~ }
  output = ${output// } "
end if
```
This instruction is designed to work with a specific format of input, and it assumes that the input is a pair of two numbers, and the second number is a pair of a movie title and a genre. The instruction modifies the movie title by inserting the tilde character, and removes the :: from the string, and removes the comma from the string, and removes the space after the tilde.

I can test the instruction using the following
